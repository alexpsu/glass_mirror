# Glass Mirror

Glass Mirror is a web application built to help a user organize their job search information. It allows a user to store job and contact information, and also has a system to track milestones for each job. I made this website using Ruby on rails, and I made it for anyone that wants to easily organize and document their job searching material. Here is the link to the website on [Heroku!](https://glass-mirror.herokuapp.com/).
